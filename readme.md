01 – Introduction

Willgame uses a hybrid merging of multiple technologies including blockchain and traditional servers. The blockchain is 2nd generation which is a POS (proof of stake) consensus model. We will supply game and app developers with the support and security of blockchain without the need of blockchain developers with out-of-the-box launchers and NFT creators that will synchronize their games and apps to the blockchain and their own in-game cryptocurrency. The NFT synchronizing and creation technology, currently under development, will allow developers of existing centralized games to upload their existing game items and assets into the blockchain as simple as uploading something to a web server to become a play-to-earn decentralized game enabling players real-world ownership of game assets and items. This will enable the Willgame blockchain to power gaming to the next level.

02 -Challenge

There are millions of MMO(Massive Multiplayer Online) games. From social environments to role play games and everything in between.Games like World of Warcraft, Eve Online, Big Screen, Decentraland, Sandbox, and millions more. What do they have in common? If you leave the game you lose all items and most times your game wealth and reputation. This is because they are not linked.

3 – Solution

Willgame is a framework for building and connecting games, where games can be interconnected allowing you to transfer your avatar, items, and wealth from one game to the next by using digital ownership. (NFT) This is called play-to-earn decentralized gaming which isn’t a new concept, and this won’t happen overnight because most of the games that currently exist can’t be converted without 1000s of hours of work.

Digital ownership of all avatars, property, items, and game currency.
The bridge that allows interchanges between networks.
Owned by the community because it’s time for the gamers to run and profit from the industry!

05 -Our Vision

"Willgame" blockchain featuring the "Willgame coin".(WLG) Our vision is to become the number one design company for play to earn decentralized gaming while also fostering an environment for the expanded use of blockchain technologies. We will do this by providing support to game developers that want to take their game to the next level of games using decentralized gaming without having to worry about blockchain integration. The game developers focus on what they do best – Develop Games, then we provide them with a turn-key operation to integrate their games into blockchain dependencies. This will lead to game players being able to transfer their game assets from one game to another seamlessly and provide an additional stream of revenue to game developers by selling the in-game assets and giving players a play-to-earn environment. It’s a win-win for all!
